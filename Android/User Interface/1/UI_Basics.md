# Basics on layout params and values

- wrap_content: tells  view to size itself to the dimensions required by its content.

- match_parent : tells  view to become as big as its parent view group will allow.

- all touch targets ike buttons should be atleast 48 * 48dp

- textSize = "__sp"

- sp stands for scale independent pixels

- sp is used for fonts.

--------------------------------------

# Colors :

use material design specs to get color codes 

- android: background="#2196F3"
- android: textColor="ffffff"

-------------------------------------------

# Image:

- android: scaleType="say, centerCrop"
  **centerCrop** -> what centerCrop does is it first scales an imageView as per the width and height without warping the image, and then crops the part which goes outside the screen.
  
  ## centerCrop , layout_height, layout_width works hand in hand.

--------------------------------------------

# Font:

- fontFamily to set font style.
- textSize to set Size.
- textColor to set color of Fonts.

# Overlapping Views

- The view which is written first , is displayed most below.
- Example: use imageview before textview or else the image will hide the textview beneath it.
