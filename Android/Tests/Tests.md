# Tests

## TDD (Test Driven Development)

- Main principle: write tests before writing code (for Unit tests)

1. Write the function signature
2. Write the test cases for that function
3. Write the function logic so that the test cases pass

- We should only have one assert per test case
- We immediately want to know the cause of failed test case
- We should have minimum number of test cases

### What makes a good test?

1. Scope
2. Speed
3. Fidelity (How close test is to real world)
4. Not a flaky test( sometimes succeeds and sometimes fails)
5. Outcome of test dependents on the test itself and not on the environment

### How many tests should I write?

1. As little tests as necessary, but also as many as necessary
