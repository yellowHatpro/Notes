# PARADIGMS

- Different programming tasks can be solved in different ways: you might need to write a function, or create a separate class with methods

- All these approaches are called paradigms

- There are 2 main paradigms: **Imperative** and **Functional**

## Imperative Paradigm

- "How to do it" approach
- One of the oldest paradigms
- Similar to orders expressed in natural languages
- Step by step instructions

- There are 3 broad categories of imperative programming:
  - **Procedural** approaches
  - **Object-oriented** approaches
  - **Parallel Processing** approaches

### Procedural Programming

- The most basic form of imperative programming
- A program is a sequence of instructions that are executed one after another in a top-down fashion
- The instructions are called **procedures** or **functions**

- The main advantage of procedural programming is that it is easy to understand and implement

- The main disadvantage is that it is not very flexible
- Programming languages that have implemented procedural programming are:
  - C
  - C++
  - Java
  - Python
  - JavaScript
  - Ruby

### Object-Oriented Programming

- A programming paradigm that uses objects to model real-world entities
- Objects are instances of classes
- Formally a class is viewed as a set of data like fields, attributes, class members, and functions, i.e. methods

- Programming languages that have implemented object-oriented programming are:
  - C++
  - Java
  - Python
  - JavaScript
  - Ruby
- The first object-oriented programming language was Simula

### Parallel Processing

- A programming paradigm that uses multiple processors to solve a problem
- The main advantage of parallel processing is that it is very fast
- The main disadvantage is that it is very difficult to implement
- Programming languages that have implemented parallel processing are:
  - C
  - C++
  - Java
  - Python
  - JavaScript
  - NESL (one of the first parallel programming languages)

## Declarative Paradigm

- "What to do" approach
- A programming paradigm that expresses the logic of a computation without describing its control flow
- The main advantage of declarative programming is that it is very concise
- It is important to specify the problem and the expected result of its solution in declarative programming

- There are 3 broad categories of declarative programming:
  - **Logic** programming
  - **Functional** programming
  - **Database** programming

### Logic Programming

- A programming paradigm that uses logic to solve problems
- Logic programming is based on the mathematical theory of logic
- The basic statements of logic programming are as follows:

  - **Fact** - fundamental assertions about the problem domain, like "Socrates is a man."
  - **Rule** - are inferences about the facts in the domain ("All men are mortal.")
  - **Query** - are questions about that domain ("Is Socrates mortal?")

  - The task here is to find the answer to the query based on facts and rules.

  - Programming languages that have implemented logic programming are:
    - Prolog
    - ASP (Answer Set Programming)
    - Datalog

### Functional Programming

- A programming paradigm that treats computation as the evaluation of mathematical functions and avoids changing-state and mutable data

- Here's a simple example: you might have a function that takes a list of numbers as input and returns a new list with the squares of those numbers. This does not change the original list of numbers.

- Examples of functional programming languages are:
  - Haskell
  - Erlang
  - OCaml
  - F#
  - Clojure
  - Scala
  - Lisp
  - ML
  - Racket
  - Scheme
  - Common Lisp
  - R
  - Julia
  - Python
  - JavaScript
  - Ruby

### Database Programming

- This programming methodology is based on working with data.

- The data is stored in the database and queries are made to this database in a special language

- For example, SQL. With these languages, you can access the data for filtering, transformations, calculating statistics, and so on.

- Program statements are data-defined rather than a hard-coded series of steps
