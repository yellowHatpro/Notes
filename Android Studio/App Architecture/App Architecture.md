## App Architecture
The most common architectural principles are: separation of concerns and driving UI from a model.

#### 1. Separation of concerns
The separation of concerns design principle states that the app should be divided into classes, each with separate responsibilities.

#### 2. Driving UI from a model
Another important principle is that you should drive your UI from a model, preferably a persistent model. 

> * Models are components that are responsible for handling the data for an app. 
> * They're independent from the Views and app components in your app, so they're unaffected by the app's lifecycle and the associated concerns.

#### Main Classes /Components in Android Architecture :
1. UI Controller (Activity/ Fragments)
2. ViewModel
3. LiveData
4. Room

These components deal lifecycle related problems.
